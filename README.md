# What is this?

This is a copy of VASM v1.8i by Volker Barthelmann with my modifications.
You can read more about VASM [here](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/).

# What's different?

I'm currently working on adding support for AVR as well as Intel HEX
output. 

This is still very much a WIP and will probably break if you try to compile it.
You've been warned.

# UPD:
- Intel HEX module is now finished and pulled into master
